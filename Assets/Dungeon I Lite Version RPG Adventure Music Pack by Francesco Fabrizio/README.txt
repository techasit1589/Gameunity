Hi! Thank you very much for downloading this pack!

Remember that this is a "Lite Version", so only 3 tracks are fully available!
If you like it, you might consider upgrading to the full Pack :)

USAGE

I'm pretty sure you already know all of this, but let's go.

Inside this pack you'll find three types of tracks: "(w tail end)", "(INTRO SEAMLESS LOOP)" and "(SEAMLESS LOOP)"
The tail end one is just the track, with the reverb tail, intended to be played once, for a cutscene, for example.

The other two are the actual Loopable tracks:

1. first, you will need to play the INTRO SEAMLESS LOOP (it is not always an actual intro, it just serves the purpose of looping better the second one)
2. then you should make the SEAMLESS LOOP track play right after the first one
3. from there, the SEAMLESS LOOP track will be your best friend, making it loop forever and ever.
